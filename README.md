# polymer-101

These are the files that I created to learn the basics of Polymer and web components. The various tut-* directories are progressive examples for a simple custom component created as I read Polymer's [API developer guide](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html).

1. Start a web server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2. Check out `tut-*` from `http://localhost:8000`.
3. View HTML source to understand how things work.
